# QuantOS-SDK  
### The Quantum Operating System for Solana ⚡

QuantOS-SDK is an **open-source optimization framework** that brings **quantum-inspired computation** to Solana transaction management.  
It simulates *flux prediction*, *priority fee calibration*, and *transaction window optimization* — providing developers with predictive analytics tools designed to **enhance throughput efficiency** and **optimize transaction execution**.

> ⚠️ **Note:** QuantOS is a research and innovation project under active development.  
> While it is stable for simulation and analytics, it should not yet be used in production dApps or live financial environments.

## 🧠 Core Concepts

### Quantum Transaction Optimizer (QTO)
QuantOS introduces a novel *Quantum Transaction Optimizer* (QTO) layer that uses pseudo-randomized modeling and deterministic algorithms to predict **network flux** and recommend **optimal execution strategies** for Solana transactions.

### Flux Prediction Engine
The **Flux Engine** estimates congestion probabilities and dynamically tunes transaction fees based on pseudo-quantum entropy analysis.

### Predictive Fee Matrix
Each transaction undergoes an *adaptive fee calculation* via simulated Q-particles to recommend efficient fee structures under varying flux intensities.
