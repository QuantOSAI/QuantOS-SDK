# QuantOS Whitepaper (Draft)

### Abstract
QuantOS introduces a quantum-inspired optimization layer that enhances Solana transaction predictability through pseudo-probabilistic modeling.

### Core Principles
- **Superpositional Fees:** Fee states exist as multiple potential paths until execution.  
- **Flux Collapse:** At submission, the optimizer ‚Äúcollapses‚Äù to one probable efficient path.  
- **Adaptive Quantum Noise:** Adds entropy to maintain decentralization simulation.

### Future Directions
- Reinforcement-trained Flux Models  
- On-chain Smart Predictors  
- Integration with Solana RPC load balancers
