# QuantOS Architecture

QuantOS integrates three layers:

### 1. Core (Rust)
- Provides deterministic pseudo-quantum computation modules
- Predicts flux using noise generation and golden-ratio weighting

### 2. SDK (TypeScript)
- Offers high-level API bindings for Solana developers
- Runs locally to simulate optimization paths

### 3. Predictor (Python)
- Generates analytics data for flux trends
- Demonstrates machine-learning-ready hooks for future research

All layers operate on-chain. QuantOS serves as a education framework for next-generation blockchain optimization.
